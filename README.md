# SpaceFusion
[SpaceFusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.11205) is a learning paradigm proposed to align latent spaces learnedby different models trained over different datasets. Of particular interest is its application to neural conversation modelling, where space fusion can be used to optimize the relevance and diversity ofgenerated responses jointly.

An implementation is coming soon...
